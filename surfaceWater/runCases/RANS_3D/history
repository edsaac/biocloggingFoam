  Replicates the RANS-2D simulation using that mesh resolution and
  using a k-wSST turbulence model. Results are quite similar to the 
  2D simulation. However, side boundaries are now walls, we should
  capture that boundary layer as well.

  Uses the same mesh resolution in the xy plane but uses a Bump for the
  z-discretization. Results are similar than the previous case but residuals
  seem lower. Boundary conditions for omega seem odd. Revised this values
  and change

  just as before but with different initial and boundary conditions for k
  omega and nut. Also, used the tanh() smoother for the SST transition
  between near-wall turbulence and inertial turbulence. Resulting U,p were
  lower! Was it because of the tanh() smother?

  clone of previous one
  remove the tanh() smothing keyword from omega and nut initial/boundary
  conditions Results are pretty much the same than the previous case. Then,
  the boundary condition of omega and nut was driving the result :( 
  Check their definitions to come up with a new experiment
